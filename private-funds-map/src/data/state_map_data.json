In recognition of this trend, the Board felt that a more effective use of our treatment funds would be to make one or more grants to the Eastside Family Dental Clinic, to be used for the same types of children the CMDF serves. The Board agreed to present the Eastside Clinic with a grant, requiring that the Clinic report the numbers of children served and treatment given. The Foundation will, however, continue to be available for assistance to certain uninsured, low-income children who have no other options for treatment.

The Farm is one of Colebrooks oldest 18th century colonial properties, settled by Revolutionary War veteran Lieutenant John Phelps and his wife Betsy Phelps in 1781, and developed by his sons Charles and Ralzemon Phelps and their descendants into an over 500 acre property including livestock and pastures, hay fields, saw mill, ice pond and quarry. The Phelps were generous benefactors of the town of Colebrook, including donating flowers to the church and stone from their quarry to build the gates to the Colebrook Center Cemetery, where Charles and Ralzemon and their families rest.Today - $93239",
