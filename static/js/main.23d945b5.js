In recognition of this trend, the Board felt that a more effective use of our treatment funds would be to make one or more grants to the Eastside Family Dental Clinic, to be used for the same types of children the CMDF serves. The Board agreed to present the Eastside Clinic with a grant, requiring that the Clinic report the numbers of children served and treatment given.
